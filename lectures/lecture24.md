# Housekeeping

- Reminder: Open Router credits are done
- Reminder: `.aider.conf.yml` format:
```
openai-api-key: sk-<your_key>
model: gpt-4-1106-preview
```
- Pull Requests:
- * Complete Environment Setup (git, ssh-keys, Aider, Mac: brew, Python (pip3...))
- * Ability to push and pull (including upstream)
- * Pull requests submitted and identify jeffrey-l-turner as reviewer/approver
- * Respond to PR feedback on GitHub
- * Assignments can be combined into single PR up to RGB [26 October assignment](../assignments/26_Oct_2023.md)
- * May wait until instructions corrected for [2nd RGB](../assignments/31_Oct_2023.md)
- * Checking use of aider (in logs and on Open AI)
- RGB final assignment - instructions incomplete
- Lightning Bitcoin node TBD
- One more quiz week after next
- Open AI credits restored this AM

## Final Project Steps

- Defining the Project
- Minimum Viable Product
- User Interface Design (overview of tools) & now [AI assistance](https://app.uizard.io/)
- * [Note](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/mobile-first): Mobile First approach, generally. Pay attention to landscape/portrait and desktop interfaces
- Back-end Services (databases, APIs/proxies, name resolution, oracles, etc.)
- Immutable Services (payments, smart contracts, oracle maintenance)
- Continuous Integration
- Project Standards (coding conventions, ecosystems used, code commit/maintenance process)
- Framework: Agile software development approach & tickets ([we're using GitHub]()https://github.com/jeffrey-l-turner/CPSC-370_BTC_derivates_AI_Chapman/issues/new)
- AI assistance (new approach) -- going to try: `formal specification`, `type/schema specification`, `code generation`, `unit testing`
