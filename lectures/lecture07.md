# Lecture 7

# Housekeeping

- Mistake on Canvas Quiz -- future ones will be only twice
- Back on track for GPT-4 Usage Budget and notify me of Rate Limiting
- Coding exercise this week
- Aider fork almost ready for Conda; M1/M2 Development working
- Investigate [AI Coding Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03622) &  ["AI x Crypto" - A16Z Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/a16z-podcast/id842818711)
- Formal Specification --> Formal Verification --> Code -- Unit/Integration Tests --> Provably Correct
- Office Hours reversed next week and in-office Tuesday -- not Thursday
- Business School collaboration: Note new Discord
- Use Warp, oh-my-zsh & my dotfiles before seeing me in office hours (see: [Warp](https://app.warp.dev/referral/PXZMWP), [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), [JLT dotfiles `wget`/`curl > ~/.zshrc` this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeffrey-l-turner/dotfiles/master/.zshrc))
- Showcase from last week

# Revisit Development Methodology

- File Navigation (e.g. `cd ~`, `cd src/<project-name>`, reproducibility & canonical form)
- Git intrinsics and usage
> * `git checkout -b <branch_name>`
> * `git merge <branch_name>`
> * `git branch -r`
> * `git log`
> * `git bisect`
- Aider Strategies
> * Branching (`git checkout -b <test-branch>`)
> * Checkpointing changes (`git checkout -b <some-short-term-branch`, `git checkout -; git merge -`)
> * Review Aider Changes (`git log`)
> * Run the Code (`npm start`, `deno task start`, etc.)
> * Ask Aider to write tests: "Add a unit test framework for this code... Write unit test for this file..."
