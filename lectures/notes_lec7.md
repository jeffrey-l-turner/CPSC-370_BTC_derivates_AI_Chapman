Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They are stored on the blockchain and automatically execute when the conditions in the contract are met.

In the context of Ethereum, smart contracts are written in a language called Solidity and run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Each smart contract has its own address on the Ethereum blockchain, and interactions with the smart contracts are transactions that are recorded on the blockchain. This enables a wide range of decentralized applications (DApps) to be built on Ethereum. You can learn more about Ethereum and its smart contracts in the [Ethereum whitepaper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/).

Really Good Bitcoin (RGB) is a protocol that allows for the issuance of smart contracts and assets on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. RGB uses client-side validation which means most of the contract information (like metadata) is stored off-chain and only the necessary information (like proof of transaction) is stored on-chain. This makes RGB a layer-2 solution on Bitcoin, similar to how the Lightning Network is a layer-2 solution for faster payments. You can read more details about RGB on the [RGB FAQ page](https://www.rgbfaq.com/what-is-rgb).

Despite the differences, the commonality between Ethereum and RGB is that both allow for the creation and execution of smart contracts on a blockchain. However, the way they handle smart contracts and store data is very different due to differences in design philosophy, scalability considerations, and the inherent characteristics of the underlying Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains.
