/**
 * Computes on chain quotes for swaps. For pure V3 routes, quotes are computed on-chain using
 * the 'QuoterV2' smart contract. For exactIn mixed and V2 routes, quotes are computed using the 'MixedRouteQuoterV1' contract
 * This is because computing quotes off-chain would require fetching all the tick data for each pool, which is a lot of data.
 *
 * To minimize the number of requests for quotes we use a Multicall contract. Generally
 * the number of quotes to fetch exceeds the maximum we can fit in a single multicall
 * while staying under gas limits, so we also batch these quotes across multiple multicalls.
 *
 * The biggest challenge with the quote provider is dealing with various gas limits.
 * Each provider sets a limit on the amount of gas a call can consume (on Infura this
 * is approximately 10x the block max size), so we must ensure each multicall does not
 * exceed this limit. Additionally, each quote on V3 can consume a large number of gas if
 * the pool lacks liquidity and the swap would cause all the ticks to be traversed.
 *
 * To ensure we don't exceed the node's call limit, we limit the gas used by each quote to
 * a specific value, and we limit the number of quotes in each multicall request. Users of this
 * class should set BatchParams such that multicallChunk * gasLimitPerCall is less than their node
 * providers total gas limit per call.
