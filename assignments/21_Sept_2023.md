### 3 Points for Grading

* `git pull upstream master # to update your local repo from class, make sure you branch from master` 
* `git checkout -b 21SeptAssignment # to create new branch from master`
* in a seperate source subdirectory: `git clone git@github.com:Uniswap/interface.git`
* `npm i  yarn`
* `cd interface; yarn`
* `aider src/ # ask aider about this code base`
* `cd <back-to-class-repo-fork>/workspaces/mySwap # inside aider`
* `> aider "write scaffolding for new crypto swap..."`
* create functional front-end for code base using aider; remember to `npm i --legacy-peer-deps; npm start...`
- Additional Hints:
> `Recreate the user interface from the this code (import code to a subdirectory that you wish to emulate)`
> `Replace the react log with the panther logo` # the panther logo is in the project src directory
> `Replace the swap interface with a drop down`
