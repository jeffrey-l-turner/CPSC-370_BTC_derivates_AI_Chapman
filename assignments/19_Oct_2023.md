# Exercise: Emulate a Decentralized Exchange Using Functional Programming

In this exercise, you will use functional programming to create a basic emulation of a decentralized exchange (DEX). We will contrast the difference between a central limit order book (CLOB) approach and an automated market maker (AMM) approach.

Use the existing `../workspaces/mySwap/` project subdirectory for this assignment.

## Exercise Instructions:

Define the core data structures:

typescript
```
// Data Structures for CLOB

type Order = {
  id: string;
  type: 'BUY' | 'SELL';
  price: number;
  quantity: number;
};

type OrderBook = Order[];

// Data Structures for AMM

type Reserve = {
  tokenX: number;
  tokenY: number;
};

type Liquidity = {
  proportion: number;
};
```

## Central Limit Order Book (CLOB):

`placeOrder`: This function should accept an order (Order) and an order book (OrderBook) as arguments. It should return a new order book with the new order added in the appropriate position, maintaining the order from highest to lowest price.

`cancelOrder`: This function should accept an id and an order book (OrderBook) as arguments. It should return a new order book with the order with the matching id removed.

`matchOrders`: This function should accept an order book (OrderBook) as an argument. It should return a new order book with any matched buy and sell orders with the same price removed. It should also return the matched orders.

## Automated Market Maker (AMM):

`addLiquidity`: This function should accept an amount of each token (Reserve) and the current reserve (Reserve). It should return a new reserve with the amounts of each token increased by the appropriate amount.

`removeLiquidity`: This function should accept a proportion of liquidity to remove (Liquidity) and the current reserve (Reserve). It should return a new reserve with the amount of each token decreased by the appropriate amount, and the amounts removed.

`swap`: This function should accept a token to remove from the reserve, the amount to remove, and the current reserve (Reserve). It should return a new reserve with the amount of the input token decreased by the specified amount and the amount of the other token increased by the calculated amount. It should also return the calculated amount of the other token.

Remember to maintain the invariant for AMM: `x*y=k`, where `x` and `y` are the amounts of the two tokens in the reserve and `k` is a constant.

Note: This exercise is designed to illustrate the basic concepts of a CLOB and an AMM in a DEX. In a real-world scenario, additional considerations such as transaction fees, price slippage, user balances, and smart contract interactions would need to be taken into account.
