# Assignment for 12 of October, 2023
## Due: by End of Day October 19th

### 3 Points for Grading

* From project root:

> `cd workspace`

> `mkdir <project_of_your choice> # name it appropriately`

> `cd <project_of_your choice> # go into project directory`

> `npm init # initialize the project repository for NodeJS` 

> `aider package.json # ask aider to setup basic User Interface - ReactJS, Svelte, VueJS are all good choices`

* It will probably be easiest to let Aider make the git management for you

> `/run mkdir src`

> `/run touch src/App.tsx`

> `create test for the App.tsx file`

* Be careful in defining your entry point to the project (`index.ts, App.tsx...`)
* Feel free to use a tools such as Bard or other AI to design the top level User Interface and components

## Concepts:
* NodeJS project setup
* Libraries in User Interface Project
* Scaffolding
* `npm start & test`
* Functional Components
