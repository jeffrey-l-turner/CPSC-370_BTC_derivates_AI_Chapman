# Assignment for 12 of October, 2023
## Due: by End of Day October 19th

### 3 Points for Grading

* From project root:
> `cd workspace`
> `mkdir <project_of_your choice> # name it appropriately`
> `cd <project_of_your choice> # go into project directory`
> `npm init # initialize the project repository for NodeJS` 
> `aider package.json # ask aider to setup basic User Interface - ReactJS, Svelte, VueJS are all good choices`
* It will probably be easiest to let Aider make the git management for you
> `/run mkdir src`
> `/run touch src/App.tsx`
> `create test for the App.tsx file`
* Be careful in defining your entry point to the project (`index.ts, App.tsx...`)
* Feel free to use a tools such as Bard or other AI to design the top level User Interface and components

## Concepts:
* NodeJS project setup
* Libraries in User Interface Project
* Scaffolding
* `npm start & test`
* Functional Components
